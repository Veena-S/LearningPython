## The Interactive Prompt
The interactive session can be started in one of the following ways in Windows:
1. Type _python_ in a Command Propmt
2. By starting IDLE GUI (in Windows 7 and later)
3. By selecting "Python(command line)" from the Start menu.

When ">>>" appears in the prompt, it means the interactive session is started.

## The System Path
Python's install directory should be included in the __PATH__ environment variable.
If not, instead of the word "python", full path to the Python executable needs to be specified for starting the interactive session.
Or, run a change directory command (cd) to go to the Python's installed directory and execute it.

## Running Code Interactively
Python interactive session starts by printing two lines of informational text giving the Python version number and then prompts for input with ">>>", when it's waiting for an input.
When coding interactively, each Python command is executed immediately when it's entered.
