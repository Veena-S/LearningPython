## Usage of Interactive Prompt

The interactive prompt can be used for doing experiments on Python expressions / statements.
It can also be used to test the code that are written in files - import the module file interactively and run tests on the tools they define by typing calls at the interactive prompt on the fly.
Sample Code:
``` Python
>>> # The following code tests a function in a precoded module that ships with Python in its standard library
>>> # (it prints the name of the directory you are currently working in, with a doubled-up backslash that stands for just one)
>>> import os
>>> os.getcwd()
'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Python\\Python36-32'
```
